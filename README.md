# Data wrangling in Python

This repo extensively explores data wangling using Python, mainly using Pandas and Numpy. I also cover data visualization and analysis using matplotlib, seaborn and folium for map representation.

The data used was obtained from survey forms. Such data is often unstructured and requires a great deal of wrangling to make it usable for analysis.

There are two projects covered here:

* National Small Business Survey using data from a 2015 survey on small businesses that covers a range of questions and attributes


* UNEB Exam Performance using data on the performance of students at PLE, UCE and UACE in Uganda from 2011 to 2015
